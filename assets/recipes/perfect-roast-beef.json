I didn't have any fresh herbs except rosemary, so chopped that with garlic, pepper, and olive oil,  and rubbed the roast with it on all sides. I let it come up to room temperature while I did other things.\nI put it in the 450 f. with convection on, oven for 15 minutes,  reduced the temperature to 325 f (without convection) and roasted for about 1 hour 10 minutes, taking it out of the oven when internal temperature reached 127 f.\nThe roast rested, covered with foil,  while I got the rest of the meal together.\nWhen I sliced it, I was Amazed! The roast was a beautiful shade of pink all the way through,  from end to end, not medium well or well done anywhere! I thought sure the center would be almost raw (if the end was pink), but no, it was perfectly pink all the way through! How does that even happen! The meat was on the lean side, and still perfectly tender.\nI just had to write and tell you how great this recipe is. I've lost my fear of roasting meat, and will always follow this recipe!!",
